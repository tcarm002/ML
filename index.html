<p>The top consumers of energy in the United States are buildings. There are many factors that lead to energy expenditure in buildings such as climate change, indoor environment quality, and occupant behavior.
   In this project, we will focus on the latter. Occupant behaviors play a key role in generating energy expenditure in buildings and  by decoding occupant behaviors, we can identify energy waste and furthermore, make suggestions and enforce policies that will curtail energy waste.Our previous work in this project proposed an information space approach for automated detection and proactive monitoring of energy waste due to occupant behaviors. Motion Planning strategies were used to capture minimal information necessary to detect wasteful states of occupants utilizing a sensor network consisting of inexpensive distance, light, temperature sensors. In this paper we focus on Machine learning algorithms that be applied to our collected data in order to detect energy wasteful states and pro-actively eliminate energy expenditure by calculating a score associated with occupants in different regions. This score will be used to suggest policies to users or facility managers to help reduce energy costs related to occupancy behaviors. We also apply clustering algorithms to correct noisy sensor data. We finally discuss a simple ranking algorithm that can be used to detect wasteful trajectories caused by energy-inefficient users.</p>
